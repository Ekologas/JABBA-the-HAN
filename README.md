Accurately assessing the status of exploited fish stocks and understanding the external environmental drivers that influence stock dynamics are key to developing effective fisheries management strategies. We integrated multiple types of data ('Data' directory) and conjointly modelled a stock assessment model and an empirical dynamic model ('Code' directory) for a commercially important fish, the Japanese Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus niphonius), in the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem (YSLME), and analysed the important factors influencing changes in its stock status, population recruitment and yield. The results indicated that the population has undergone dramatic changes during the study period and has been in a healthy state in recent years. Fishing pressure, sea surface temperature, fisheries management (summer fishing moratorium) and regional climate indices were important drivers of shifts in biomass, recruitment and yield of the population. In addition to spawning biomass, the most critical variables for predicting recruitment were fishing pressure and an annual summer fishing moratorium. This suggests that moderating fishing via management based upon robust scientific evidence can ensure the sustainability of food production from a fish population under pressure from climatic stress.
